      "message": "I found a few bug reports like this one: https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/4352\n\nI also reproduced part of the problem in a very simple test.  In that test I verified that the following scenario results in a failure:\n* There is an ON_CALL for a mock method\n* There is a later EXPECT_CALL for the same method that is more specific\n* The test case calls the mock method twice, once that matches the EXPECT_CALL and once that matches the ON_CALL\n* gmock reports this as a failure, saying they both should have matched the EXPECT_CALL and falling back on the ON_CALL is an error.\n\nHowever, when I modified the real test cases to have more EXPECT_CALLs to work around this problem, I still ran into a more mysterious problem.  About 6 different tests failed, and all of failure messages blamed the EXPECT_CALL in doUpdateOnePSUNotPresent().  I verified that each test case is constructed/destructed in sequence - they are not created in parallel.  I also verified that the constructor was correctly creating a new MockedUtils and the destructor was deleting it.  So I have no idea why an EXPECT_CALL in one test case (TEST_F) would have any effect on other test cases.\n\nThis CI failure just started happening last week when the openbmc-build-tools repo was updated with new commits.\n\nI have spent about 3 days on this, so I decided to make the simple change in this commit.  If someone else has time to further debug, maybe they can find a better fix.",
